hello ðŸ‘‹

this code uses Open Weather API and tkinter along with other python frameworks to create a weather app

it consists of three types of codes which captured my thought process: 
  1. skeleton.py -> a practice code that runs through terminal to understand how Open Weather API works
  2. main.py -> elevates skeleton.py and prints its data from terminal to the user's screen
  3. converter.py -> implements a conversion button for temperature scale on screen
